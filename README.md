# Fruit Into Basket

* **Purpose** - To gain familiarity with data structures and algorithms
* **Description**
  * You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array fruits where `fruits[i]` is the type of fruit the `i`th tree produces.
  * You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:
      * You only have two baskets, and each basket can only hold a single type of fruit.
      * There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
  * Given the integer array fruits, return the maximum number of fruits you can pick.




## Objective
* Ensure that all test cases in `com.github.curriculeon` pass with 100% success rate.
